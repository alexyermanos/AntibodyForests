# Delineating inter- and intra-antibody repertoire evolution with AntibodyForests

The generated wealth of immune repertoire sequencing data requires software to investigate and quantify inter- and intra-antibody repertoire evolution to uncover how B cells evolve during immune responses. Here, we present AntibodyForests, a software to investigate and quantify inter- and intra-antibody repertoire evolution.  

This R package is currently composed of a pipeline to reconstruct lineage trees from 10x single-cell V(D)J sequencing data preprocessed with the [Platypus package](https://github.com/alexyermanos/Platypus) and compare trees within and across repertoires. Furthermore, it has modalities to integrate bulk RNA sequencing data, features of protein 3D structure, and evolutionary likelihoods generated with protein language models.
